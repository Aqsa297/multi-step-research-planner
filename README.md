# Multi-Step Research Planner using Agent-Based GenAI

## Project Overview
This project implements an intelligent agent that automatically converts a research topic into a structured study plan.

## Workflow
1. Topic understanding
2. Task decomposition (planning)
3. Reference retrieval (tool usage)
4. Study plan generation (narrative output)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Agent-based logic
- Generative AI concepts (simulated)

## How to Run
1. Open main.ipynb
2. Run all cells in order
3. View the final generated study plan

## Output
A step-by-step study plan with recommended readings and expected outcomes.
